    "\n",
    "* Open a shell or command prompt (cmd in Windows) and type: `jupyter notebook --generate-config`\n",
    "\n",

    "  * Windows: `C:\\Users\\<username>\\.jupyter\\jupyter_notebook_config`\n",

    "  <br>\n",

    "  and change it to (note the `#` that is removed at the start of the line):\n",

    "      c.NotebookApp.notebook_dir = '<your_path>'\n",
    "\n",
    "  Be sure to use forward slashes in your path.\n",
