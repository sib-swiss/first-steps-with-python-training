    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In many use cases, you will want your python code to **read/write from/to files** stored on your local hard drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code design aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few important points to consider when working with files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Where is my file?\n",
    "* Do I need to read the entire dataset/file into memory?\n",
    "    * Accessing the hard drive is among the slower operations a computer performs. \n",
    "      Reading an entire file when you only need the first few lines will be costly\n",
    "    * If you are reading a very large file, having the entire file in memory at \n",
    "      once may overburden your computer's memory (RAM).\n",
    "* Are there concurrency issues?\n",
    "    * If another software (or even your own code if you have messed up) writes to a file you \n",
    "      are currently reading, you could run into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical aspects\n",
    "\n",
    "* Whether it is for reading or for writing, operations on files occur using **file objects**\n",
    "  (sometimes also referred-to as **file handles**).\n",
    "* In modern python, files are opened with a so-called *context manager* statement, which takes\n",
    "  care of properly opening and closing the file once you are done with it.\n",
    "* This context manager takes the form of a **`with open(...) as ...`** statement. Note that context\n",
    "  managers are code blocks, and their content must therefore be indented:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Open a file in a given \"mode\" (e.g. read, write or append).\n",
    "    with open(filename, mode) as file_handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Do something with the file... (note the indentation)\n",
    "        # ...\n",
    "\n",
    "    # When you are outside of the context manager block, the file is automatically closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### `filename` argument: where is my file located ?  <a id='1.1'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument that `open()` takes is the **file name**, which **may include the file path** (relative or absolute) if the file is not located in the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass the correct value to `filename`, you will need to know:\n",
    " 1. where your file is,\n",
    " 2. and where you *code is executing from* (i.e. what is the working directory when you code runs)\n",
    " \n",
    "We leave question 1. to you, but with Jupyter Notebook, the second question has an easy answer: your code is executed where the jupyter notebook is saved (with a more classical python script, the code executes from the directory where you called `python`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to make sure that our code can find the file:\n",
    "* **If the file is the same folder as the code**, then you can just use the name of the file,\n",
    "  no need for further modification.\n",
    "* **If the file is elsewhere**, you will have to specify a path to the file.\n",
    "  This can be either a:\n",
    " \n",
    "    * **Absolute path:** from the root of the computer to the file. e.g.,\n",
    "      - `\"C:\\Users\\JohnDoe\\Desktop\\ProjectP\\data\\myFile.txt\"` (Windows)\n",
    "      - `\"/home/JaneDoe/Documents/ProjectP/data/myFile.txt\"` (Linux,Mac)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Relative path:** from your code to the file. e.g.,\n",
    "      - `\"data/myFile.txt\"` - here the file is in a subdirectory named `data`.\n",
    "      - `\"../otherProject/myFile.txt\"` - more complex, the file is in a subdirectory of the parent directory.\n",
    "      - *Note:* `..` indicates the parent directory of the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The last case - `\"../otherProject/myFile.txt\"` - depicts a situation like this:\n",

For instance, the `\"r\"` mode will only allow to read the content of a file, and not to write to it (this is useful to avoid accidental writing to the file).\n",

    "* **`\"a\"`**: open file in write-only mode, **appending** to an existing file with the same name\n",
    "  (otherwise the file is created).\n",

    "Now that we have a **file object** (file handle), we can use it to read from the file.  \n",
    "When reading a file with python, you can consider your file object a bit like a cursor which starts at the beginning of your file, and progresses toward the end of the file (it can go backward, but it is often a bit hacky to do so).\n",

    "\n",

    "You can read elements (ie. make the cursor advance) using the following methods:\n",
    " * **`.readline()`**: the most common, reads a single line.\n",
    " * **`.read()`**: reads the remainder of the file (from the current cursor position) in one go.\n",
    " * **`.readlines()`**: reads the remainder of the file (from the current cursor position) in one go,\n",
    "   and returns a `list` of `str` (string), where each element of the list is a line of the file that\n",
    "   was read: `[\"line 1...\", \"line 2...\", \"line 3...\", ...]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "> All these methods return the text they read as `str` (string objects). This means that if you read\n",
    "  a number and want to use it as a `float` (e.g. to do math with it), you will need to convert it\n",
    "  from `str` to `float` yourself (with `float(x)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's focus on **`.readline()`**, the most used method. When we call it, the file pointer progresses to the next line and returns the line that was just read as a `str` object.\n",
