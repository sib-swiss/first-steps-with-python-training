    "## Introduction <a id='1'></a>\n",
    "-------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "In many use cases, you will want your python code to **read/write from/to files** stored on your local hard drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code design aspects: where is my file <a id='1.1'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few important points to consider when working with files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Where** is my file?\n",
    "* Do I need to read the **entire dataset/file into memory**?\n",
    "    * Accessing the hard drive is among the slower operations a computer performs. \n",
    "      Reading an entire file when you only need the first few lines is costly.\n",
    "    * If you are reading a very large file, having the entire file in memory at \n",
    "      once may overburden your computer's memory (RAM).\n",
    "* Are there **concurrency issues**?\n",
    "    * If another software (or even your own code if you have messed up) writes to a file you \n",
    "      are currently reading, you could run into trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical aspects: the `with open()` context manager <a id='1.2'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether it is for reading or for writing, operations on files require a **file object** (sometimes also referred-to as **file handle**).\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern python, files are opened with the syntax: **`with open(...) as ...`**.\n",
    "* Such statements staring with the **`with`** keyword are called **_context managers_**.\n",
    "* Context managers are code blocks that **do something** automatically when you enter them, and\n",
    "  also when you exit them.\n",
    "  * In the case of `with open(...) as ...`, the context manager opens the file when enter\n",
    "    the context manager, and automatically closes the file once you exit it (in addition, the\n",
    "    context manager also closes the file if an error occurs while the file is being accessed).  \n",
    "  * This is a nice feature, because it means that you will **never forget to close the file**.\n",
    "* Since context managers are code blocks, their content must be indented:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Open a file in a given \"mode\" (e.g. read, write, or append).\n",
    "    with open(filename, mode) as file_handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Do something with the file... (note the indentation)\n",
    "        #\n",
    "        # Inside the context manager block, we interact with the file\n",
    "        # using the \"file_handle\" variable (or however we named it).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    # When you exit the context manager block, the file is automatically closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `filename` argument: where is my file located ?  <a id='1.21'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument that `open()` takes is the **file name**, which **may include the file path** (relative or absolute) if the file is not located in the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To pass the correct value to `filename`, you will need to know:\n",
    " 1. Where your file is,\n",
    " 2. Where you *code is executing from* (i.e. what is the working directory when you code runs)\n",
    " \n",
    "We leave question 1. to you, but with Jupyter Notebook, the second question has an easy answer: your code is executed where the jupyter notebook is saved (with a more classical python script, the code executes from the directory where you called `python`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to make sure that our code can find the file:\n",
    "* **If the file is the same folder as the code**, then you can just use the name of the file,\n",
    "  no need for further modification.\n",
    "* **If the file is elsewhere**, you will have to specify a path to the file.\n",
    "  This can be either a:\n",
    " \n",
    "    * **Absolute path:** from the root of the computer to the file. e.g.,\n",
    "      - `\"C:\\Users\\JohnDoe\\Desktop\\ProjectP\\data\\myFile.txt\"` (Windows)\n",
    "      - `\"/home/JaneDoe/Documents/ProjectP/data/myFile.txt\"` (Linux, Mac)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * **Relative path:** from your code to the file. e.g.,\n",
    "      - `\"data/myFile.txt\"` - here the file is in a subdirectory named `data`.\n",
    "      - `\"../otherProject/myFile.txt\"` - more complex, the file is in a subdirectory of the parent directory.\n",
    "      - *Note:* `..` indicates the parent directory of the current directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The last case - `\"../otherProject/myFile.txt\"` - depicts a situation like this:\n",

    " | \n",
    " ├─ ProjectA\n",
    " |     └─ myCode.ipynb\n",

    "       └─ myFile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `mode` argument: the file opening mode  <a id='1.22'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the `open()` function, the optional **`mode`** argument can be passed to the function. This specifies the type of access you need on the file. For instance, the `\"r\"` mode will only allow to read the content of a file, and not to write to it (this is useful to avoid accidental writing to the file).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several possible modes when opening files:\n",
    "* **`\"r\"`**: open file in read-only mode. This is the **default value** of the `mode` argument.\n",
    "* **`\"w\"`**: open file in write-only mode. This **overwrites** existing files with the same name.\n",
    "* **`\"a\"`**: open file in write-only mode, **appending** to existing files with the same name\n",
    "  (if the file does not exist yet, it is created).\n",
    "* **`\"rb\"`**, **`\"wb\"`**, **`\"ab\"`**: same as `\"r\"`, `\"w\"` and `\"a\"`, but reading/writing to/from binary files (such as `.zip` or `.bmp` image files). The content is read/written as bytes objects without any decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "See `help(open)` or the [python online documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) for a full list of modes and details about them."
